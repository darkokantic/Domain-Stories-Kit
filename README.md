Draw.io icons used to record Domain Stories

To start recording Domain Stories with draw.io you can devise your own icons. But if you do like our icons you are welcome to use them. To import them into draw.io, first download the DomainStoriesScratchpad.xml file from this public git repository.

Then open the draw.io diagram and go to the Scratchpad section on the left-hand side. Click on the pencil icon to open the edit Scratchpad modal window. Click on the Import button and import the DomainStoriesScratchpad.xml file. The icons should now appear in the Scratchpad section.
